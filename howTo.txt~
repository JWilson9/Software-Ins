To run my file I have a file where it is used for the user.
It displays a menu for the user, this menu consists for four options
1) backup system, 2) Restore, 3) Choose a different directory
4) exit the program

# To back up the system the user just enters in 1

# to restore the system the user just enters in 2

# to choose a different folder directory used for the user to backup and restore
# their files they enter 3, then enter in the directory they want to save it to
# for example /home/ubuntu/Documents, or enter in blank not to change the file 
# directory.

# The user enters in 4 to exit the program.
